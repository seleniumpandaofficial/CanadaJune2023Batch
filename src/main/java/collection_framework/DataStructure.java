	//                int, short, byte, long, char, float, double, boolean
	
	//2. Non Primitive DS. Further divided into two types
	//2.1 Linear DS - String, Arrays, List, Set, Queue, ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, etc
	//2.2 Non Linear DS - Graphs and Trees

	//Collection framework is a pre-defined API (interfaces, classes, methods)
